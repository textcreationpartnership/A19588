            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ilst it is thus, there will be no end of controuerſies.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, wiſe and godly learnedmen, haue vpon great and mature deliberation, thought it fit to ſpare the labour, (ſo often formerly ſpent in vaine), and to <hi>ſuperſede</hi> for a time from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing any more, the matters ſo ſufficiently already debated, but ſo inſufficiently heard and iudged: and haue held it a better courſe, (both for their conuerſion, and ſetling of our owne) to diſcouer the fouleneſs &amp; manifold abhominations of poperie, both for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine &amp; practice: which if many that be ſeduced, did but ſee in the true colors, ſurely they would ſtrike themſelues on the breſt, &amp; be aſhamed; &amp; hating this darkneſs, would long &amp; look for light.</p>
            <p>At this end haue I aimed in the courſe of my poor ſtudies: and that I might be furniſhed with their own records, I haue ſpared no coſt to get them, nor time to peruſe them; and do proteſt vnto your Ho. &amp; the world, the reading of their owne books (eſpecially the lateſt of all) hath driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me into a deeper deteſtation of popery, then any thing that euer I heard or read of it, out of our writers. wherof whether ther be cauſe or no, I dare refer my ſelf to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your L<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. or any of indifferency, vpon ſight of theſe excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I here make againſt them; which were for the moſt part deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at the Croſſe before a reuerend &amp; honorable audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: where hauing firſt diſcouered in the body of that religion xx. woundes, wide, and deep, &amp; deadly, euen ſuch as ſtrike at the hart &amp; life of
<pb facs="tcp:15500:3"/> a Church; the end I then droue at was to proue, that <hi>the Romiſh</hi> Babylon <hi>is not healed of theſe wounds, to this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being done, it is ſtrange to ſee how they ſpurned at it, and me for it; affirming openly, it was nothing but a heape of lyes and ſlaunders, that I am not able to proue what I ſayd, nor dare ſtand to it, that wee are ſet vp to raile on them, and haue licences to lie on them, and make them odious before our people: and in the countrie they diſperſed, I was call'd before authoritie for it, and cenſured, and ſilenced for ſlandering &amp; rayling on the catholicks and that I was ſtricken by Gods hand, with a ſtrange hoarceneſſe after I began to raile on them; and could not ſpeak, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therfore to honour the truth, and to cleer my ſelfe, but much more to ſhewe that it is no trick nor policy of our State (as it is in poperie <note n="c" place="margin">A book was printed in engliſh in the colledge at Rome, wherin it is affirmed that wee take Catholicks, and drawe vppon their legs bootes ful of hot boiling liquor, and vpon their feet hot bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning ſhooes: and do put them into beares skins, and caſt them to the dogs to be pulld in peeces: all this and many ſuch other ſet down in pictures.</note>), to ſet vp men with authority to raile and lie, therby to make our enemies odious; I haue bin induced to publiſh what was ſaid &amp; ſo to iuſtifie out of their own records what was affirmed of them. I ask them no fauor, I ſeek no corners, I refuſe no triall; but let me be heard, and then iudged and ſpare not. If the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars<note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. THe Pope is a God, &amp; the Lord God, and ſuch a head of the Church, as infuſeth ſpiritual life &amp; heauenly grace into the body of the Church. <hi>pag.</hi> 53. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pope hath done more then God: for he deliuered a ſoule out of hell. <hi>pag.</hi> 57. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath diuided his kingdome with the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> keeping Iuſtice to himſelfe, but committing and giuing vp his mercie to her; ſo that a man may appeale from him to hir, <hi>pag.</hi> 60. &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="6">6. The holy Scriptures are therefore of credit, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, becauſe they are allowed and autorized by the Pope: and being by him authorized, they are then of as good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as if the Pope himſelfe had made them. <hi>pag.</hi> 73. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Images are good books for lay men, and better &amp; eaſier then the Scriptures. <hi>pag.</hi> 80. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

            <p n="10">10. The Pope may and doth grant Indulgences, for a hundred thouſand yeares, and giue men a power to redeem ſoules out of Purgatory. <hi>pag.</hi> 103. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Pope may annexe Indulgences for many thouſands of yeares, to ſuch beades, Crucifixes, pictures and other like toies, that are hallowed by his hands. <hi>pag.</hi> 107. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The popiſh Church baptizeth bells. <hi>pag.</hi> 115. &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="16">16. Some men had better lie with another mans Wife, or keepe a whore, then marry a wife of his owne. pag. 143. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Prieſts in popery may not marry, but are permitted to keep their whores, vnder a yeerely rent. <hi>pag.</hi> 147. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Such Prieſts as be continent, and haue no whores, yet muſt pay a yearely rent, as they that haue, becauſe they may haue if they will. <hi>pag.</hi> 150. &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prevent all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits that might ariſe vpon the ſo late co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forth of this Sermon, ſo many weekes expected, I deſire thee good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be ſatisfied; the cauſe thereof, was a long &amp; vnlooked for journey. And now that you haue it, let me deſire all men in the reading &amp; iudging therof, to deale with that ingenuity and ſinceritie, as I haue ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored in the writing of it. My co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſpeakes for me, I haue forged no new Author, I haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified none, I haue corrupted none, I haue to my knowledge miſalledged none: I haue taken no proofe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bare report, nor haue I produced our men to proue what I lay againſt them: nor is there
<pb facs="tcp:15500:6"/> one quotation of any Authour of theirs, which I haue not diligently peruſed afore-hand, and the whole ſcope of the place. If any ſhould thinke of anſwere, I deſire him let paſſe all perſonall ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and by-matters, and come directly to the points in iſſue: which be theſe;</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Whether the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>teach &amp; practice in theſe xx. or xxi. points, as I haue charged her withall, or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>If ſhe do, whether they be healed of theſe wounds as yet, or no.</hi>

               <p n="3">3 <hi>If ſhe be not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how ſhe can be the true Church, which is ſo wounded, and will not be healed.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>If they doe not teach and practice ſo, I will yeeld the Cauſe. And hee that can ſhew me that either ſhe is healed ſince, or beeing not healed, how ſhe can be the true Church, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare him, and thank him. I deſire all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelues Papiſts, or their fauourers, not to be ſo wilfull as to condemne what they know not, but onely to giue it reading, and then iudge as they ſee cauſe. <hi>Wright,</hi> in his Articles, layeth to our charge many ſtrange Paradoxes: as, that <hi>wee are all Atheiſts, and Infidels by our doctrine;</hi> that <hi>wee are bounde by our doctrine to doe no good workes,</hi> and many ſuch. And <hi>Kelliſon</hi> in his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaies,
<pb facs="tcp:15500:6"/> thruſts vpon vs that <hi>wee deny Chriſt to bee the onely Sauiour,</hi> and <hi>Judge of quicke and dead,</hi> and many ſuch abhominations; all which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and deteſt: yet, do what we can, we muſt haue them layd vpon vs; and our Writers &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue their ſpeeches wrung and wreſted, beyond their meaning to make them ſound that way. I dare appeale to the iudgement of Gods Church, and all Iudicious Readers heereof, that I haue not done ſo with them, nor taken vantage of their words, when it's apparant they meant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; but charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely with ſuch points of doctrine and practice, as themſelues cannot deny but to be their owne: and that not of one or two, but (for the moſt part) generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Commending it to thy reading, and my ſelfe to thy prayers, I leaue vs all to Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. At the Temple. May, 21. 1608.</p>

For howſoeuer to deſtroy the literall and hiſtorical ſenſe of the olde Teſtament (with ſome old, and many late writers that be Papiſts) is worthily condemned by the Church as iniurious to Gods word: Yet the literall ſenſe once layd, we may then warrantably extend the text to the allegoricall ſenſe, as far as we ſee the holy Ghoſt in the New Teſtament, to go before vs, or to giue vs leaue.

                  <p>Firſt therfore let vs obſerue this generall doctrine, namely, that a good man loues his very enemies, and not <hi>deſireth</hi> onely but euen <hi>ſeeketh</hi> their good: this did the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to their enemies &amp; perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. For theſe Babylonians had done the greateſt hurt to the Church and kingdome of Iſrael, that euer one nation did to another: for firſt they inuaded their land vniuſtly; then they beſieged and took <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the ſeate of the kingdome, tooke and ſlew their kings, ouerthrew their Kingdom, ruinated their State, burnt their Temple, defaced their Religion, killed whome they would, caryed captiue whom they would, and ſo left their land a heape of deſolation <note n="g" place="margin">Read for this purpoſe the laſt chapt. of this prophecy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ends of the books of kings and Chronicles.</note>: And yet worſe then all this; being their Captiues at <hi>Babylon,</hi> there they mockt them in their miſerie, and ſcoft at their Religion.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus to doe is a mark of Gods childe, and a ſigne
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15500:12"/> of a true Church. For to doe euill for euill, and good for good, is no more then nature; <hi>euen the publicans,</hi> (ſayth Chriſt) <hi>doe ſo much</hi>

                  <p>Thus we ſee generally, they wiſhed her well: But what is the particular good they wiſhed her? namely, her healing and conuerſion. <hi>We would haue healed her:</hi> heere many things might be preſſed, I wil but point at them. 1. That it is the property of a holy man, to wiſh aboue all things the ſpiritual good of them with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he liues: the wicked man ſeekes the ſpirituall hurt of men; the naturall man the carnall good: but the holy man their ſpiritual &amp; eternall good. Worldly matters haue their time &amp; place in his thoughts: but that that takes vp, &amp; poſſeſſeth his deſires, is the ſpirituall good of them he loues, namely, their conuerſion, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, their ſaluation: theſe things be worthie their praiers, and worthy of their pains. Heerin Gods children are like to God their Father, who wiſhing good to his people, crieth out: <hi>Oh that there were in them</hi> (not the skill to riſe in this world, and attaine the honours &amp; eaſe of this life, but) <hi>a heart to feare my Commaundements, that ſo it might goe well with them and theirs</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 5. 25</note>. God wiſheth no trifles to his children: But oh (ſayth God) that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were healed:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:15500:13"/> and oh ſayth <hi>Iſrael</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> were healed! Thus do God and good men accord in their wiſhes. Learn thou, here, thy duty, if thou be Gods: thou wiſheſt for, and prayeſt for, and ſeekeſt for many things for thy children, and thy friends, thy wife and family. Thou clotheſt them, &amp; feedeſt them, &amp; prouideſt for them (elſe thou art <hi>worſe then an Infidell</hi>) and preferreſt them, and much more: but all this is for the bodie. But, canſt thou ſay, from a good conſcience, <hi>I woulde haue healed their ſpirituall diſeaſes: I haue heartily wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and faithfully endeuoured their ſaluation.</hi> This is to be a true friend, a true father, a worthy husband, and a good wife: happie they that haue ſuch friends neere them. 2. Obſerue further, they ſeeke the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euen of their perſecutors: ſo doth alwaies the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man. <hi>Paul</hi> was put in priſon, the <hi>gayler</hi> tormented his body, and <hi>Paul</hi> healed and ſaued his ſoule <note n="w" place="margin">Act. 16. 24. to the 35.</note>. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſinner, is made a happie man, by his priſoner: &amp; the Martyrs oft times by their patience, their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers &amp; holy inſtructions, conuerted their executioners and tormentors. As in the former point, a holy man is like to <hi>God:</hi> ſo herin, to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who when <hi>Iudas</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> were conſpiring his deſtruction, the ſame houre was ordaining the holy ſacrament, and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the meanes of their ſaluation <note n="x" place="margin">1.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Iſrael</hi> liues in <hi>Babel,</hi> &amp; would gladly haue her as holy as themſelues; <hi>wee would haue healed her.</hi> It ſheweth the excellency of the nature of holy things: they are <hi>fire,</hi> not in the flint, hardly bet out; but, <hi>in the boſome, that will not be concealed.</hi> A man is not coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of them: He is indeede greedie to gaine them; but not to keepe them ſecret and to himſelfe, as in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15500:13"/> worldly things wee are: nay he deſires and ioyes to impart them to others; and it is the ioye of his heart to ſee others as good or better than himſelfe. <hi>Woulde God</hi> (ſayth <hi>Moſes) all Gods people were Prophets:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed from his heart, not <hi>Felix</hi> the preſident and <hi>Agrippa</hi> the king alone, but that <hi>all that hearde him,</hi> were like him; not a priſoner and <hi>in bonds,</hi> but in <hi>grace and goodneſs</hi> 
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Act. 26. 29</note>. Hardly ſhall a man heare ſuch voices in the world; I wiſh others were as rich as I, as high as I, as learned as I, as much in credit and fauor as I. No: theſe things make men baſe and ſeruile, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louers and priuately minded: but grace and holineſſe is of a royall and excellent nature, and inlargeth the heart wherein it is, with ſuch loue to other men, as nothing more contents him that inoyeth it, then to make others as good as himſelfe. Laſtly, where it is ſayde, they <hi>woulde haue healed the Babylonians</hi> with whom they liued; ſee what a good neighbour, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is: he comes, he dwelles, he ſoiournes in no place, but hee ſeekes the good of it. <hi>Lot</hi> would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do good in <hi>Sodom:</hi> if hee can doe none, at leaſt <hi>his righteous ſoule ſhall be vexed, for their ſinnes</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15500:14"/> and a ſweet ſauour of his vertues. Thus euery place is better for him where he comes: and when he is gone, his memory is bleſſed, his vertues prayſed, his name honored, &amp; his perſon loued.

                  <p>Neuer bragge that <hi>Abraham</hi> is of your religion, and therefore you are antient: for his Father and his Grand-father were ours, and therefore we are elder.

Firſt the pittifull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of wicked men, They are wounded; nay, they will bee wounded, but will not bee healed; they will wound themſelues, but neither can heale themſelues, nor will let others heale them: are not they worthy to periſh? they are in the fire and neither will come out, nor let others pull them out: are they not worthy to burne? being in priſon, the doore ſet open to them, and they will not ſtir to come out; are they not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee ſlaues for euer? they are deadly ſicke: the Phyſition comes to them that is able to heale them, and they will not heare him: are they not worthy to die? O deafe adders that ſtop their eares againſt the voice of the beſt and wiſeſt charmers! and yet theſe men are the mockers, and ſcorners of them that bee

                  <p>Further, heere wee may ſee how it fares with Gods children in this world; oft times they muſt loſe their labour, when they haue ſincerely, and zealouſly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured the conuerſion of ſinners. <hi>Iſrael</hi> would haue healed <hi>Babel:</hi> but when all is done, ſhee will not bee healed.

For it is apparant in the Goſpell how little he preuayled with many of his own nation, yea with the learned Rabbines the Scribes and Phariſies <note n="a" place="margin">Luke. 7. 30</note>: And after all the excellent ſermons made all the time before, went not <hi>Iudas</hi> away fuller of Sathan then he came <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 27</note>?

                  <p>Wee muſt heere learne, not to bee diſcouraged in our courſes of ſeeking mens conuerſions; Priuate men to practice the duties of admonition, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. vnto their neighbours that bee out of the waie: Nor Miniſters, to preach the word, with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.

                  <p>For the firſt, <hi>how</hi> is <hi>Babel</hi> to be <hi>forſaken</hi> when there is no more hope of curing her? the anſwere is, not in <hi>loue</hi> and affectionate deſire to do her good: but ſtill the wicked man is to bee pittied, ſtill to be loued, ſtill to be mourned for, ſtill muſt the godly man wiſh well to him, tho he care not for it, but ſcoffe at all. Thus when the Prophet had called vpon the people, <note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 13. 16. 17</note> 
                     <hi>Heare and giue eare, be not proud, but yeelde and turne and repent, and giue glory to God before he ſend darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi> Hee then addeth: <hi>But if you will not heare and obaye, my ſoule ſhall weepe in ſecret for your pride, and mine eyes ſhall drop downe teares, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the good man ſends vp many a ſigh, and ſheads many a teare for the wicked, that neuer gaue one groane for themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we forſake them in prayer; but tho they ſeeme to vs neuer ſo incurable, wee muſt ſtill pray without ceaſing to GOD for them: for <hi>that that is impoſſible to vs, is poſſible inough with the Lord (h).
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15500:21"/> God forbid (ſayth</hi> Samuel) <hi>that I ſhould ceaſe to praie for you</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt <hi>forſake Babel.</hi> Firſt in regard of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: wee muſt ſeparate our ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans companie and ſocietie, as far as lawfully &amp; conueniently we may, after we ſee him obſtinate and incurable: it is Gods commandement, <hi>Flee from the midſt of</hi> Babel; <hi>depart out of the land of the Chaldeans</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Ierem. 50. 8</note>: and do not this ſlackly &amp; ſlowly (like <hi>Lots</hi> wife <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>but be as the hee Goates before the flock.</hi> Secondly, in regard of the meanes: for after that by her often and obſtinate refuſall, (ioyned with ſpightfull contempt both of the means and the men that brings them) ſhe hath ſhewed her ſelfe to be a <hi>filthy ſwine, then pearles
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:15500:21"/> are no longer to bee cast before her, holy things muſt no more bee giuen to ſuch Dogges;</hi> but they are to bee left to their vomit and mire, till God ſhew either his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or iuſtice vpon them, either in their conuerſion or confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus muſt ſhee be forſaken: and the reaſon why (which is the ſecond point) is double.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regarde of our ſelues: wee muſt forſake the wicked when they are incurable, leaſt in ſteede of dooing good to them, wee take hurt our ſelues, by beeing polluted by her contagion, or made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of her ſinnes; and conſequently, of her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God giueth this reaſon himſelfe: <hi>Flee out of the middeſt of</hi> Babel, <hi>and deliuer euerie man his ſoule, be not deſtroyed in her iniquitie</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Ierem. 51. 6</note>. Therfore, after that a chriſtian man perceiues there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to get hurt from them, then hope to do good to them, he is bound no longer to ſtay; nay, hee is bound to leaue them and look to the ſafety of his owne ſoule and body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the means vſed to heal them: which becauſe they be the holy ordinances of God, &amp; pretious pearls; therfore are they not to be expoſed to the contempt of wicked men, nor to be trodden vnder the foule feete of their peruerſe and ſcornefull ſpirits: Both theſe reaſons doth Chriſt couple together, <hi>Giue not that</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that is holy to dogs, neither caſt your pearles before ſwine, leaſt they treade them vnder their feet, and turning again all to rent you</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 7. 6.</note>. Chriſt would neither haue his ordinances abuſed, nor his children hurt by the wicked men.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee the <hi>maner how,</hi> and the <hi>reaſons why:</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:15500:22"/> Now let vs ſee the <hi>time when Babel</hi> muſt be forſaken; when ſhe is incurable, but not til then: firſt, long time is to be ſpent, all meanes to be vſed, all waies to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all patience to be practiced, and all wiſdome to be exerciſed, all occaſions to bee taken, that probably may preuaile to doe them good. But if after all this, they be incurable, and out of hope; <hi>then</hi> muſt we <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them,</hi> but not till then, not till there bee no hope at all: he that forſakes <hi>Babel</hi> till then, is wanting in his dutie, and hath much to anſwere for before God. For if the Phyſician may not forſake <hi>this vile body</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Phil. 3. 21</note> as long as there is any hope of life; then how may anie man forſake the ſoule that is pretious, <hi>and that cost ſo pretious bloud</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 19</note>? Surely, the ſpirituall Phyſician muſt neuer forſake a Church, a people, or a man, as long as there is anie hope of curing and conuerting him.</p>
                  <p>Heere is condemned the practice of two ſorts of men amongſt vs. Firſt, ſuch as be now tearmed <hi>of the ſeparation,</hi> formerly and vſually called <hi>Browniſts;</hi> who forſake our Church, and cut off themſelues from our congregations, and ſeparate themſelues to a faction, and faſhion, or as they call it, into <hi>a couenant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of their owne deuiſing; theſe men haue made a grieuous rent, and giuen a deepe wounde into the peace of our Church: they vſe this place and others like againſt vs, &amp; ſay; <hi>We would haue healed you, but you will not bee healed, therefore we forſake you:</hi> but they abuſe the place; therefore, I will turne the point of this their weapon againſt themſelues: I meane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their errors, and this their bitter and ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeparation. To this end I would aske theſe men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15500:22"/> but 4. queſtions: whereunto if they can giue me ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I will be one of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, whereas you ſay that <hi>Wee are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded incurably, and will not be healed, I aſke: Wherein</hi> are wee deadly or incurably wounded? what funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall wound is in our doctrine? what deadly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is in our diſcipline, ſuch as eats out the heart, and life, and being of a Church? what book of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall ſcripture receiue we not? what holde wee for Canonicall, that is not? what ſacrament that Chriſt ordained do we want? and what haue we more then Chriſt ordained? what article of faith deny wee? or what holde we for an article of faith that is not? what fundamentall hereſie doth our doctrine maintaine? what haue wee in our Church, that ouerthrowes the being of a Church? what is neceſſarily required to make a Church, that we do want? Do not ſay, Theſe be many queſtions: for if you wil haue them all in one generall, I will end it as I began; Wherein are wee deadly &amp; incurably wounded? If I ſhould walk a while on your owne grounds, &amp; grant you that which you can neuer proue; yet will it not follow that we are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably, or deadly,</hi> wounded. A man may want a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or haue ſome blemiſhes in his face, and yet bee a ſtrong and perfect man, ſound, and heart-whole, and able to ouerthrowe his enemies: ſo, tho there were in our Church, thoſe wounds you ſpeake of, yet do they not come neere the heart, they bee not deadly, they may blemiſh the beauty, but endanger not the life of our Church. The Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> had other kind of blemiſhes then ours hath; bleſſed be God. <hi>Corinth</hi> doubted or erred in the great article
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15500:23"/> of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> 1. Cor. 15. The Galathians erred fouly in the high and maine point of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> and yet <hi>Corinth</hi> a <hi>Church of God ſanctified in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> 1. Corinth. 1. 2. And Galatia, though almoſt <hi>remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to another Goſpell,</hi> Galathians. 1. 6. yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>a Church</hi> for all that. Galat. 1. 2. And if you will adde to theſe fundamentall errours in doctrine, corruptions in manners, and diſorders in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, you can with no ſhewe of truth lay ſuch to the charge of our Church, as is apparant were rife in the Church of Corinth: and then ſhall Corinth bee a Church, and not England? Let the Lord bee Iudge betwixt you and vs. Therefore, if wee ſhould grant vnto you that our Church were blemiſhed or woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet not beeing <hi>deadly wounded,</hi> your ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from vs is ſchiſmaticall and vniuſt: and more cruell and vnchriſtianlie deale you with our Church, then did Gods Church with <hi>Babell;</hi> who <hi>forſooke her not til ſhe was deadly wounded,</hi> and paſt life. To conclude, if <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not forſake <hi>Babel</hi> til then; then what are you that dare forſake a Church of God, wherin they haue found God, if euer they haue found him yet, &amp; wherein the diuell himſelfe cannot ſhewe one <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound:</hi> Bleſſed be the Lord that hath ſo healed vs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſeeing they ſay that we are wounded, but as for themſelues they be healed, &amp; therfore they muſt ſeparate, and ſo keep the ſound from the ſicke; I aske them this queſtion: Are they healed? then where were they healed? where were they called? where were they regenerat &amp; begotten to Chriſt? was it not in the wombe of this our Church, &amp; by means of the immortall ſeede of Gods word, that is daily ſowen in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15500:23"/> our Church, &amp; by the miniſtry of thoſe men that were called by our Church, and yet cleaue to our Church, and mourn for their ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and by the dewe of that bleſſing from aboue, which is dayly poured vpon our aſſemblies, from Gods merciful right hand? Then how can they deny that to be a true Church, a holy church, a Church of God, wherein ordinarily men are called, and brought to God? And how vnthankfull and vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull are they to their ſpirituall mother, to forſake hir and caſt the duſt of contempt in her face that bore them in her wombe, and brought them foorth the ſonnes of God? To auoid this, what can they ſay, but one of theſe two things: either that there is indeed a true Miniſtery of the word amongſt vs; but it is not powerfull to anie but themſelues: that wee haue the word truly preached, and ſo as it may conuert a man; but it is not the ſauour of life to anie, but ſuch as come into their couenant: (but from this horrible, and helliſh pride, good Lord deliuer them; or els let them be aſſured ſuch a height of pride, is ſure to haue a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fal.) Or if not this, then muſt they ſay that they were not called, in our Church, but ſince they left vs: But they haue bard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues already from that plea. For, it being obiected to them that they haue left our church, not out of conſcience, but out of carnal diſcontents, and vpon fleſhly reaſons, worldly grounds; they all ſtoutly anſwer and ſtifly ſtand to it, that they do it not vpon any ſuch grounds, nor for anie reaſons of fleſh and bloud; but meerely and onely out of conſcience and for their ſaluation, and that gladly they would haue ſtaied, but with a good conſcience they could not. If this be true, then they had conſcience before they left vs: then
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15500:24"/> where came they to that conſcience and care of their ſaluation, but in our Church? Now, a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience cannot be ſeuered from regeneration and an effectual calling: therefore, they cannot deny, but they were regenerate, and called in our Church; vnleſſe they wil ſay, they had no conſcience when they forſooke vs: which if they doe, then I will yeelde that my queſtion is anſwered.</p>
                  <p>If they grant they were called a fore they went, and that ſtil they who fall from vs to them, are called; then how can that be but a true Church, wherein by their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, men are ordinarily begotten to God? &amp; how can that be but a lawful &amp; holy miniſtery, which brings men to ſaluation? therefore, (vpon their own grounds) they haue no iuſt cauſe to leaue vs. For that Church and Miniſtry that brings a man to <hi>grace,</hi> and to <hi>faith,</hi> is able to bring him to <hi>glory</hi> &amp; <hi>ſaluation:</hi> and that which is able effectually to <hi>begin,</hi> is able effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>finiſh</hi> the good worke of God in any man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if they be healed, and we ſtill deadly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then I ask them: How haue they ſought, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently endeuoured our healing? and till they haue done all that poſſible can be done for our healing, <hi>how dare they forſake vs?</hi> For if the Iſraelites might not forſake <hi>Babel</hi> till then; ſhall they forſake vs, afore they haue put all meanes to the fartheſt? if they be healed alreadie, why doe they not more ſeriouſly labour the healing of others? They cannot but knowe, there bee manie in our Church curable inough, if they coulde ſhew them to neede their healing: why then doe not they ſtay amongſt vs, to heale and helpe vs? He is no good Phyſician, that flies and forſakes his Patient:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15500:24"/> they therfore, if they be healers, and would heale vs as they pretend, why do they not ſtay with vs, &amp; ſhew vs our wounds, and apply the means to heale vs? But contrariwiſe, they forſake vs, and runne into corners and raile on vs, and call vs <hi>Babylon, Antichriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>ſynagogue of the wicked,</hi> and that wee are no Church, and CHRIST is not amongſt vs. Are theſe the plaiſters with which you will heale vs? is this the waie to heale, to make wounds wider and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then indeed they be? Hee is a pitifull Phyſician that makes his Patient worſe then hee findes him: but he is not tolerable, that makes him worſe then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is, or will make him belieue he is hearte-ſicke and deadly, when his finger aketh. They alledge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and that therfore they cannot ſtay with vs but are conſtrained to leaue vs: but aſſuredly (were it true that they ſay, that we were deadly wounded, and they able to heale vs) then, ſeeing they cannot ſaie that all amongſt vs are incurable, they would care for no danger that could befall their bodies, ſo that they might heale our ſoules and gaine them to God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, that if wee would grant them their owne grounds, that they are as good as they pretend to be, and wee as ill as they would make vs; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, their ſeparation is vnchriſtian, becauſe its certaine none of them can haue aſſured teſtimony to his conſcience, that hee hath done all hee can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly for our healing: till which time no man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake another; eſpecially no Chriſtian forſake another: &amp; leaſt of all a priuate man forſake a Church. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and laſtly, if they will needes leaue our Church, whither wil they go? To leaue one thing, for another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15500:25"/> no better, is ſeely; but for a worſe, is folly and madnes. But they will ſay they leaue vs to take the better: then ſhewe me a better religion, and a better Church then the Proteſtant Churches of Europe are, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion amongſt them. You will not goe to the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranes, for they (you ſay) are worſe then we: much leſſe to the Papiſts, for they apparantly are worſt of all: whither then? will you goe to the Church of the Lowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countries? but they are of our confeſſion. will you go to the Churches of <hi>France?</hi> but they are of our confeſſion? will you goe to the Church of <hi>Geneua,</hi> or the free Cities of the Empire? but they are of our religion. will you goe to the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> to the States, and Princes of <hi>Germany?</hi> but they are all of our confeſſion, and ſo profeſſe themſelues to be <note n="q" place="margin">See the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</note>. Looke ouer all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and you ſhall not find a Church that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth ours, nor any that is not of our religion, nor anie one but that profeſſeth it ſelfe to bee of the ſame confeſſion with vs, and not to differ from vs in anie ſubſtantiall or fundamental point. Whither then wil you go, or what remains for you to go vnto, but vnto your corners &amp; conuenticles, where you are your own caruers, your owne Iudges, your own approuers, but haue not one Church in Chriſtendome to approoue you.</p>
                  <p>So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it remains, it muſt either be granted you, that you are better then all others, and that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Goſpell preached thus long, ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing of Anti-chriſt) there is not one true Church in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world but your ſelues: or els you muſt grant that there is no better Church for you to goe vnto, if you forſake vs. Therefore plaie the wiſe mens part; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:15500:25"/> not our church, til you can ſhew a better. And tell vs not of <hi>France, Scotland, Geneua, Zurick, Baſil, &amp;c.</hi> for they be all ours, and not yours: they will and do all approue vs as a glorious Church, and condemn you, as factious, and ſchiſmaticall. And ſeeing you can finde none better (all things conſidered) and haue none to fly to but your ſelues (who are the parties now in queſtion, and therefore no fit Iudges of the matter) look well about you; and if vnaduiſed zeale haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this bitter ſeparation, then by your returne make vp that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>1. Are the daies euill? the more need haue they to be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by each ones helping hand. And if we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wounds in Church or State, more cauſe hath each one that loues the peace and health of Ieruſalem, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour the preſent healing therof, leaſt they feſter and growe worſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, are the times euill? Nay, are they not made euil by thee? at leaſt, are they not the worſe for thee and thy ſinnes? Who can ſhew his face and ſaie; I haue committed no ſins, that may be in part a cauſe to bring downe the ſpirituall and corporall plagues that are amongſt vs? Then what are they that are ſo buſie to complaine of the times, and ſo ſlacke to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15500:26"/> of their ſins? But it is a trick of hypocriſie, to be ſo eagle eied in prying into the illneſſe of the times, &amp; ſo blind and dull in conſidering his owne ſinnes, the cauſe of all that ill. Thou therfore, contrariwiſe, out of a holy and humbled heart confeſs, that ſeeing thy ſins haue made the times worſe then els they would haue bin, therfore thou haſt cauſe to endeuor for thy part to make them better. Then ſet thy ſhoulder to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and put thy necke to the yoke, remembring that euen <hi>Babel it ſelfe is not to be forſaken, till it be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incurable,</hi> &amp; paſt all hope: But being incurable (as here the text ſaith) ſhe is; therfore, ſaith the church, <hi>Let vs forſake her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Babel</hi> being forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, what remaines to be expected? nothing but vengeance and deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>IN theſe words is laid downe the laſt point; namely, what becomes of <hi>Babel,</hi> when being incurable ſhee is forſaken by the Church: ſhe is <hi>made ready for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and destruction.</hi> Here we may learne (amongſt many others) 2. moſt worthy doctrines.</p>

See, God the good King is more carefull to ſaue one of his own ſeruants, then to deſtroy a thouſand enemies: but ſee their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they mocked and flowted this <hi>Lot,</hi> ſcorned him as a ſtranger, and many waies grieued his righteous ſoule, were weary of him, and his company, and tryed euery waie, to make him wearie of the Towne; for they held it worſe, as long as he was in it: at laſt they haue their wills, and hee forſakes them; but with him their protection is gone, and now fire, and brimſtone, falls from heauen on them. So, at this day do the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and worldly men: whom hate they, whom accuſe they, whom abuſe they, whom lie they in waite for, whom perſecute they, whom would they deſtroie, whom baniſh they, whom are they weary of, but of the godly men?

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, we may here learn what a feareful &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous thing it is not to be healed by ſpiritual Phyſick (that is) not to profit by the word of God, nor to bee conuerted from ſinne, when God giues meanes.

For as if at noon day any man ſay the ſunne ſhines not, it is becauſe hee is blinded and cannot ſee: ſo, if in the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpell, ſome ſee it not, but in the midſt of that light liue in darkneſſe, its certaine they are blinded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and if they continue ſo are marked vp for iuſt damnation. A fearfull example we haue hereof in the ſonnes of <hi>Eli,</hi> of whom the Text ſayth, their Father hearing of all the euil they did, called them and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, and gaue them good and ghoſtly counſell, able (a man would haue thought) to haue turned their hearts; eſpecially comming from a Father, and from him that was the Iudge and Prophet of the Church: But all in vaine; for, notwithſtanding, <hi>they obayed not the voice of their father:</hi> and mark the reaſon; <hi>becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi> Whereby its apparant, that there is not (ordinarily) a ſurer ſigne of a reprobate, then not to obey the voice and word of God, nor to profit by thoſe meanes that God giues a man for his conuerſion.</p>
                  <p>A matter of ſpeciall vſe to our Church, which hath ſo long enioyed the Goſpell: but to you of this Citie eſpecially, who haue long and liberally been fed from heauen, with abundance and variety of ſpiritual food. Therfore, euery one looke to thy ſelfe how thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteſt by theſe good means. For be aſſured, if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or particular man haue vſe of the meanes &amp; profiteth not, but runneth on hardned in his ſinnes; it is becauſe he is a veſſel of Gods wrath and prepared for damnation: but contrariwiſe, he that heareth and

Therfore, let euery one take heed: for otherwiſe his lot will be like <hi>Babylons;</hi> of whome we here finde that becauſe all meanes vſed to conuert her were in vaine, therefore ſhe is now iuſtly deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and remains a monument of miſery, and a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Gods iuſtice, to all poſterities <note n="x" place="margin">Read, for this end, the 50. and 51.

               <p>Thus its apparant, his chief throne is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the 7. hils: and it is very obſeruable, that howſoeuer they make their ſucceſſion from <hi>Peter;</hi> and that therfore in reaſon his Church ſhould haue bin chief yet that God may ſhewe to the world that their Citie is <hi>the Whore that ſitteth on ſeauen hilles;</hi> therefore, by Gods iuſt iudgement they are ſo blinded, that they haue made a Church and Palace, that is on one of the hils, ſuperior to that they call S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and haue given it not only prioritie, and precedence, but euen priuiledge &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence aboue S. <hi>Peters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another anſwerable reaſon out of the Text is; <hi>That Citie</hi> (ſaith the Text is <hi>Babylon) which reigneth ouer the kingdoms of the earth</hi>

               <p>The 1. and 2. is paſt, the 3. is in hand, &amp; the fourth is ſure to come: its true wee would haue healed her; its moſt true ſhee is paſt cure, I hope it ſhall be as true that we ſhall quite forſake her; and the laſt haſtens faſt on, her deſtruction is at hand and ſleepes not.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. That we would haue cured the Papiſts, we dare call the world to witneſſe, and appeale euen to God himſelfe; and this not onely deſired but ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured it by all good means, both in the daies of that renowned Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of happie memorie, and in the preſent gouernment of our Souereigne that now is.</p>
               <p>The meanes we haue vſed for their healing be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe. 1. By inſtructing, &amp; informing them in the truth, &amp; diſcouering their errours both by holy Scriptures, and by the ancient Fathers of the beſt &amp; pureſt times. <hi>Iewel, Fulk, Whitakers, Rainolds, Perkins,</hi> and manie other, who now ſleep in Chriſt, haue left behind them ſuch teſtimonies of this truth as ſhall liue whilſt the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15500:30"/> world laſteth, and neuer can be confuted, as appeares in that they haue not dared to anſwere moſt of their books to this day. Secondly, our continuall praiers for them, both publick, and priuate; in performance of which dutie, both our Church in generall, and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs (that vſe to pray for themſelues) haue the teſtimony of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, that they haue not fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to indeuour their healing by this means. This our diligence in this duty, ſo ſhamed them for their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame for vs, that 4. years ago they publiſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> a forme of Litanie, and publick praier, for the peruerting of the Realms of <hi>Eng.</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie <note n="m" place="margin">Vide libellu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inſcriptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae &amp; pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, we haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to heale them by our example, profeſſing and practicing our owne religion, daily in their ſight: &amp; many of our fathers profeſſed it openly, euen in the times when they preuailed, and gaue their liues in the fire for it. And heerin the example of noble Queen
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15500:31"/> ELIZABETH is worthie of eternall memorie, whoſe conſtant zeale to the truth was ſuch, as that all her dayes they could not by their brags, and treaſons, and curſes, cauſe her once to feare them; nor by all their ſleights, could euer win the leaſt eſtimation with her, nor gaine an inch of ground in her heart: nay, her laſt Proclamation, not two Moneths afore her death, wounded them as deeply, or rather more then euer any one before. <note n="o" place="margin">See the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Feb. before her death.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; wee endeuoured their healing, by deuiſing and enacting good and wholeſome lawes againſt their errours, ſuperſtitions, impyeties, &amp; ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſes: ſomtime in iuſtice executing them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in great mercy ſuſpending them; thus try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all meanes that might poſſibly perſwade or worke vpon them: and in this courſe (our State by wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and diſcreete managing the lawes; our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie by inſtruction and confutation, and all by their prayers and example) did we continue to endeuor hir healing, all the happie daies of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But eſpecially dare wee call the Lord to witneſſe, that wee haue endeuoured her healing ſince the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie comming of his Maieſtie to this crowne; wherein all the forenamed meanes haue beene vſed and one more: their errours haue beene moſt learnedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and confuted, their bookes and libells aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and if I may giue my iudgement of theſe daies, the skirtes of the Romiſh Whore were neuer better diſcouered, her groſſeſt abſurdities and fowleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeties neuer ſo cleerlie diſplayed, as haue beene by the Diuines of this preſent age. I ſpare their names, in regarde they bee aliue: and long may they liue,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15500:31"/> to the happineſſe of this CHVRCH.</p>
               <p>And beyond all meanes then vſed, and now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, his Maieſtie hath vſed one more; namely, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable lenitie, and extraordinarie patience towardes them, notwithſtanding all their ill deſeruings: which as it was alwaies great; ſo, ſince the helliſh powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaſon it is incredible: for he whoſe patience is not prouoked, and whoſe iuſt anger is not wakened by ſuch an attempt, ſure there is ſomthing more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily humane, in that man.</p>
               <p>Neither do I think is there a King in Chriſtendom, that after ſuch a treaſon would haue left one of that faction in his kingdome, but onely his Maieſtie. Oh mirror of mercie! how famouſly in future ages ſhall this princely bountie be renowned! and how fit is he to be the Lords annointed, and to be the Lieutenant of that God <hi>whoſe mercie is ouer all his workes;</hi> ſeeing his mercie is ſo largely extended euen ouer his worſt deſeruing ſubiects. Thus Heauen hath ſeene it, euen the Lord himſelfe will witneſſe with vs, that as all his Church euery where ouer the world, ſo wee in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for our parts, would gladly haue healed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and haue done our full endeuour to that ende: But now alas ſee the effect of our labours, all is loſt; for <hi>ſhe is Babylon,</hi> and therfore paſt cure: <hi>She wil not, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be healed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Som wil ſay this is harſh &amp; bitter: but I ſay it is true, and therfore is not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed: let her blame them that haue made her incurable, and not them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it: and for me that affirme it, I craue not to be belieued, but rather to be reprooued, if the euidence of the fact do not fully proue what I haue ſayd.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:15500:32"/>
               <p>To this end I will firſt lay downe a ground or two.</p>
               <p>Firſt that in former times there haue been great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of foule deformities in the Romiſh Church, made by men of great learning, and ſuch as either are, or at leaſt whom they ſay are, their owne: and theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities not onely in priuate perſons, but in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke bodie; not in the members only, but in the heade of their Church.

               <p>Another ground: theſe deformities were ſo fowle and ſo apparant, that the Councels of Conſtance, and Baſil, and (of later times) that of Trent, were called to this principall end, for the reformation of the Church both in the head, and in the members.

               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, I proue it by a fewe particulars in ſteed of manie: and firſt for the Councell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that Councell decreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. ſuch decrees, as tend rather to the ruinating of all religion, and ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all humane ſocietie, then any whit to the curing of diſeaſes either in the one or other.</p>
               <p>For firſt, whereas it is knowen and granted, that Chriſt at his laſt Supper ordaining the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, did conſecrate and giue it both in bread and wine, and commanded his Miniſters after him, <hi>Doe this</hi>

               </q>
               <p>This wrong was neuer offered to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before: neither was there euer any Popiſh gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell, ſo preſumptuous afore this of <hi>Trent,</hi> that euer durſt adde more books to the ſacred Canon, then we receiued from the Church of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>Here is a ſtrange decree, that the ſtreame ſhall bee of more vertue then the Fountaine, a tranſlation of more authoritie then the Originall. The former ages neuer heard of this indignitie: but whenſoeuer doubt was made, or difference found, recourſe was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with had to the Originalls for the determining of the matter. Many learned Papiſts are aſhamed of this, if they durſt vtter it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Coccius</hi> doe bewray it by their ſlight handling of the matter; for they would gladly prooue if they could, that <hi>Hierome</hi> was the author of that tranſlation: but as for the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it (whoſoeuer was the tranſlator) aboue the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginalls, they are wiſer then to venture their credits vpon ſo falſe a matter, and therefore do wholly leaue it vpon the credit of that Conuenticle that concluded it. Neither do I wrong, to call it a Conuenticle: for tho I ſhould grant the whole to be a Councell; yet the number that paſt this bill was ſo ſmall, that I may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call it a Conuenticle.

               <p>And thus I hope wee haue cleered it, that theſe two Councells, called in the corrupt and declining times of the Popiſh Church, in ſhewe to haue reformed it, haue been ſo far from that, that contrariwiſe they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded diuerſe enormous impyeties that were not before: Then is not the Romiſh <hi>Babylon</hi> well cured?</p>
               <p>I haſten to the ſecond Propoſition: which is, that the deformities that were before, both in doctrine and practice, both in heade and members, and manie whereof were complayned on by ſome of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, doe yet remaine without redreſſe or reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For the demonſtration of this Propoſition, I might inlarge my ſelfe into many particulars; but I will inſiſt but vppon fewe: and thoſe I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſhall not bee trifles, nor triuiall, but of great moment, euen touching the mayne and morall duties

Well then ſeeing this is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh doctrine and practiſe, both olde and newe, both long agoe and now preſent, let vs make a little vſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wee ſee heere good reaſon, why a Papiſt ſhould holde the Pope aboue a Councell, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the holy ſcripture it ſelfe: for the Pope is God; and wee knowe that GOD is aboue the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why alſo the Pope holdes himſelfe aboue kings: for hee is God, and GOD is King of kinges: in a word, no maruell why hee ſhould take ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from all the world, we are a triple Crowne, bee caried on mens ſhoulders, giue his foote to be kiſſed, diſpoſe of kingdomes and kings at his pleaſure; for hee that is God may do more then all theſe. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we Proteſtants muſt needes grant, that as truely as he is a God, ſo lawfully may hee do all theſe. All theſe vſes are as good as that is the Pope himſelfe makes, when hee ſayth: <hi>God may not be iudged by men; but I am God, and therefore may not bee iudged by man:</hi> theſe bee his arguments: but now hee ſhall giue mee leaue to make but one for him and his fellowes.</p>
               <p>The God that admitteth <hi>another Lord God,</hi> and to bee worſhipped as God; is not the Lord Iehouah, the true God: <hi>for the true God, is God alone</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note>: but the Papiſts God admittes of another Lord God, and to be worſhipped as God, therefore hee is not the true God.

               <p>I would end this: but I cannot omit to make one vſe more of this their doctrine. It hath been made a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion amongſt them, whether the Pope might no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 22. 29.</note>: and <hi>Dauid</hi> in his thankeſgiuing, at the preparation for the Temple building, confeſſeth to God; <hi>Thine O Lord, is greatneſſe, power and glorie, aeternitie and Maieſtie: Thine O Lord is the kingdome, and thou excellest ouer all</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">1. Chron. 29. 11.</note>: and if the Frier had obiected, that the kingdome indeede is Gods, yet not ſo, but he may diuide it to another: then they would haue aunſwered, that cannot bee: for hee himſelfe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:15500:40"/> ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, &amp;c. My glorie, I will not giue to another</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Eſay. 42. 8</note>: and if hee ſtill obiected, that was true in the olde Teſtament, when there was none capable and worthie of this honour, becauſe then the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> was not; they would readily aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that in the newe Teſtament after the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> was, and after ſhee was the mother of Chriſt, Chriſt her ſonne ſpeakes to <hi>God his Father,</hi> (but not to <hi>her his Mother) Thine is the kingdome, powre and glorie</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 6. 13</note>. The kingdome is Gods: and how longe? (not till ſhee bee aſſumed and crowned in heauen, as they ſay, but) <hi>for euer and euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas they further teach, that hee hath kept Iuſtice to himſelfe, but <hi>commited mercie to his Mother:</hi> they would crie out vpon that doctrine and him that taught it; and tell him that they finde it ſixe and twentie times in one Pſalme, that <hi>Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie indureth for euer</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 136, in euerie verſe.</note>, <hi>and that his mercie is ouer all his workes</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 145. 9</note>: if ouer all, then ouer her alſo, or elſe ſhee is not of his making: and if his mercie bee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, without which ſhee could neuer haue beene ſaued: then how dare any ſay, that <hi>Mercie is Hers, and not Gods?</hi> and if <hi>mercie bee Gods,</hi> and that mercie of his <hi>endureth his,</hi> (not for the time of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, but) <hi>for euer:</hi> Then it is foule and falſe doctrine to ſay, that now ſince Chriſt, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned vppe mercie from himſelfe to a creature: thus would the people come vpon him that taught this doctrine, and vppon the Romiſh Church that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it: and therefore doth not that Church wiſely, to keepe the people from reading the holy Scriptures?</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:15500:41"/>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing it is doctrine currant in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, that God hath giuen vp mercie from himſelfe to the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> here is a good defence of their Ladies Pſalter <note n="d" place="margin">Vide officia, &amp; Pſalteria bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae Mariae Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is cuiuſeun que generis ſeu impreſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note>: wherein they turne the Pſalmes from <hi>Dominus</hi> to <hi>Domina,</hi> from GOD to our Ladie: and when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Lord haue mercie on mee; they ſay, O Lady haue mercie on mee: and in thee O Lady is my truſt.

               <p>Fourthly, here wee ſee the reaſon why the Popiſh Synagogue do maime the Lords prayer, leauing out the concluſion, <hi>For thine is the kingdome and power and glorie for euer and euer</hi>

               <p>But to conclude, (leauing this robberie and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in cutting off part of the Lords prayer, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place and purpoſe) it is here euident that no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt in the World can with a good conſcience ſay the whole Lords prayer. For if God haue now <hi>diuided his kingdome,</hi> then how can hee ſay with <hi>Dauid</hi> in the olde teſtament <note n="i" place="margin">1. Chr. 29. 11</note>, and Chriſt in the newe <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 6.</note>: <hi>Thine O

Alas, poore ſoules, what ſhould a ſimple honeſt hearted Papiſt do in this caſe! See therefore in what pitifull ſtate they liue, who haue ſubiected themſelues to ſuch tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let it bee obſerued that here they teach, that there bee in ſpiritual matters touching the ſoule 2. diuine Courts: the one of <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and that is <hi>Gods;</hi> the other a <hi>Chancerie,</hi> a Court of <hi>Mercie,</hi> and that is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> theſe bee their verie wordes: and further, that <hi>if any man feele himſelfe agrieued in Gods Court of Iuſtice, let him appeale to the Court of mercie of his Mother:</hi> Oh-ſtrange diuinitie! Canne Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee vniuſt, or his proceedinges erroneous and vnequall? If they bee not, then why do they talke of appealing to a higher Court? for why do writtes of error lye from one Court to another, but that it is preſuppoſed that they may erre? and why is there a <hi>Chauncerie,</hi> but that the rigour, and extremitie of the Lawe may bee mitigated?

                  <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 119. 137.</note> then this is blaſphemie of a high nature, that there needes a Chancerie to rectifie his proceedinges and mitigate his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But as for this doctrine, that <hi>the Chauncerie or Court of mercie is not Gods, but his Mothers, and that therfore Gods iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are to be mitigated by another, and therefore that ſhee and her Court are in this reſpect</hi>

               <p>Further, obſerue how the <hi>Croſſe</hi> is ſayde to haue <hi>deſerued to beare Chriſt:</hi> ſurely no maruell tho Saints can merite, when a peece of wood can merit at Gods hands. Laſtly, let all reaſonable men iudge what the Romiſh Church holds of Chriſts death; ſeeing they praie to a wodden Croſſe, to beſtowe the fruite and benefite of it vpon them.</p>

Now if it bee naught, why doe they not ſay ſo, and therfore put it out? if it be good, why do they put it out? So then it may be couered, but is not cured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere that though they haue left out that, yet they haue kept in as bad or worſe: for euen in their neweſt editions, and as they ſay moſt reformed, there is praier to this Croſſe. <note n="i" place="margin">Breuiarium Rom. autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Concil.

               <p>But it is not the name we ſtand vpon, but the matter: concerning which, whereas they pray that the ſound of that bel ſo waſhed and ſanctified as afore <hi>may driue

If they knowe the prayer to be impoſsible, not to haue anie warrant, but meerelie to bee a ſtate Ceremonie, and done to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze the poore people &amp;c. then it appeares they bee Cozeners and Atheiſts that make Religion a pretence to all their purpoſes: But if it be in earneſt, and they knowe it to bee a prayer of faith, and haue warrant from Gods word for it, then it were poſſible to driue awaie the diuell and all his temptations out of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for ſo manie Belles might bee hallowed and waſhed, as might hang, one within the reach of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers ſound; and ſo if the wordes of this prayer be true, a Diuell might not ſtay in the realme: and that Realme were very worthie to haue the Diuells com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, that would not willinglie be at the coſt to haue ſo manie bels though they were of ſiluer, and to haue them baptized though it were in coſtly water.</p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleaſeth to ſport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a little with vs and ſayth; <hi>The Heretickes obiect to vs that wee baptize Belles; but its maruell</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that they doe not alſo ſay, wee catechize and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, that ſo they may ſound out the Articles of Fayth</hi>

So then if a Cardinall haue but the conſcience to tell a lie (which, how ſmall a thing it is in poperie, and how manie excuſes it hath, who knoweth not?) then it is heere apparant that the vileſt theefe, and murderer in a countrie, may eaſily eſcape the halter at <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Now to conclude, ſee how many helpes there be for a Murderer in Romiſh religion; firſt by places, then by perſons priuiledged. Places priuiledged be, 1. a Church, 2. a Churchyard, 3. an hoſpitall, 4. a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops houſe, 5. a priuate Chappell; all theſe ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer a man from tryall (were this ſo in <hi>London,</hi> how ſhould any murderer be brought to the Bar? no ſtreet could he paſſe through, but he ſhall finde one of theſe 5. places): then by perſons priuiledged; which be, firſt, <hi>a Cardinall riding by:</hi> which becauſe it is but in fewe places; therefore the ſecond is <hi>a Prieſt carying the Sacrament,</hi> and that is in euery towne: To touch ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, doth deliuer from death a murtherer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by law.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, a bloudy Church is a defender of bloud and murther; for let anie wiſe man conſider, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand murders in a yeere, may bee ſheltred and ſhuffled ouer by theſe meanes.

               <p>But I anſwere further, he could and might hinder it, and will not.

               <q>That whores taking mony of men, for their ſinne, bee they maried or vnmaried, tho it be neuer ſo much aboue their due, are not bound to reſtore anie of it againe, if it bee once giuen them; and giues a reaſon for it, becauſe, ſaith he, this action is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt iuſtice, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Certainly the ſtewes are much beholden to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Tollet</hi> for this doctrine: but, what Iuſtice and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, and the Church, and the truth and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe do owe him for it, hee feeles afore this time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he repented. <note n="t" place="margin">Obijt Tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tꝰ.

               <p>Thus it is the preſent doctrin of the Romiſh church that ſhe alloweth ſtewes by publicke toleration, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide greater euills, and cenſureth not the whores for it; nay, ties them by a lawe to refuſe no man, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15500:78"/> tyes men by a lawe to pay the hire; and for this ende allowes them Courts, Iudges, and Officers, and takes part of the benefit ariſing.

A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table reaſon, if it be well conſidered: for hereby it is apparent that Poperie teacheth her people to vow againſt mariage, but not againſt fornication; againſt wiues, but not againſt whores. Alas, alas, what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is this, doth mariage breake their vow, and not fornication? God keepe all Chriſtians from ſuch vowes.

               <p>Thus it is plaine: Poperie voweth againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not againſt whoredome, adulterie nor forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

               <p>Theſe were the words of this good man, too good to bee a Pope, at leaſt too good to be long a Pope: for after that he had ſo much forgot himſelf, and his Papall dignitie, and the honour of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall ſeate (which cannot erre, nor doe amiſſe, as he like a foole confeſſed) as to grant that not the Church alone, but the holy Court of Rome did need reformation, forthwith there was order taken that hee ſhould not trouble the world nor diſgrace his place any longer, for ſhortly after he died: &amp; for his ſake, they prouided that their ſeate ſhould neuer be ſo farre abuſed and abaſed againe by any plaine hearted Northren man, making ſure from that day to this, that the Popedom ſhould not be truſted out of the hands of an Italian, leſt he ſhould euer haue a thought of reformation. For what followed after all this? Was there any reformation in the Romiſh Church? were any of the euils and diſeaſes confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Adrian</hi> redreſſed? I had rather <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> their own Biſhop ſhould tell, then I; which becauſe he doth very largely, I will contract it into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium, and hope that ſome will take paines to put all that wiſe and learned diſcourſe of his into our vulgar tongue: the rather for that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taineth much matter of great moment, &amp; yet not vulgarly knowne to this day.

His ſucceſſor <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. was not ſo idle to hearken to ſuch toyes, nor giue way to ſuch innouations, hee would haue no Councell, he ſaw no cauſe of reformation. But from his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> the 3. plaine neceſſitie did wring out an vnwilling conſent, and ſo after many difficulties, the Councell of Trent was called, wherein firſt of all this point of reformation was ſo vrged, that a Committe was choſen of nine principall Diuines, ſome of them Cardinals, to conſider what reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was requiſite in the Church; who after mature deliberation, plainly told the Pope, that all theſe euils proceeded from the abuſes raigning in the Court of Rome: and concluding ſomething for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of pluralities (one only abuſe), the Pope did ſo interpret it, and alter it, when it came to him, as it did no good but hurt. He then dying, and the Councell being intermitted, was ſet on foote again by his ſucceſſor <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3: who alſo confeſſed there were innumerable abuſes in adminiſtring the Sacraments: but when it came to reforme them, in ſtead thereof hee ſuſpended the Councell, though many Biſhops, that deſired reformation, did proteſt againſt it, affirming confidently that they had not as yet diſpatched one of the buſineſſes, for which they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15500:91"/> had aſſembled: but the Pope preuailed, and ſo for tenne yeeres it was diſcontinued. And at laſt being againe aſſembled by <hi>Pius</hi> the 4. he made ſhew hee would referre the whole matter of reformation to the Fathers of the Councell: but when it came to trial, it was with a prouiſo, that, firſt, they ſhould not meddle with the Court of Rome: ſecondly, that in their reformation, laid vpon other perſons and places, they ſhould alwaies enact it thus; Sauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies holy and vntouched the Authoritie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical ſea: for which their courteſie to him &amp; his ſeate, he afterward gaue them thankes in an oration in the Conſiſtorie at Rome, aſſuring them (but it was in the word of a Pope) that he would be more rigide and ſeuere in purging his owne Court, and houſe and offices, then they would haue bin. With theſe good words the Pope diſſolued the Councell. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day to this (ſaith this Biſhop) through theſe ſo many yeeres, nothing is done, nothing is changed, nothing is amended in the Church: and no maruell (ſaith he) for nothing haue they amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Rome vnder their owne noſe, where they might reforme any thing if they had conſcience and will to doe it. So that now ſeeing all is finally referred and reſerued to the Pope, there is (ſaith he) no more hope of any reformation left, nor any thing elſe remaines, but to ſee one miſerie after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall vpon the Apoſtolicall ſeate and the whole Church.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many more words to this purpoſe hath this wiſe and learned Biſhop. Out of all which I conclude: therefore 30. or 40. yeeres agoe in the
